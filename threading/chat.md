help me write a simple threaded application in cpp with proper handling of threads and mutexes
ChatGPT

Sure, I can help you create a simple threaded application in C++ that demonstrates the use of threads and mutexes for synchronization. Letâ€™s create a small program where multiple threads will increment a shared counter. We will use std::thread for threading and std::mutex to protect the shared data.

Here is a basic example of how you can achieve this:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <vector>

std::mutex mtx;  // Mutex for protecting the counter
int counter = 0; // Shared variable among threads

void incrementCounter(int numIncrements) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numIncrements; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); // Lock the mutex until the end of the scope
        ++counter; // Increment the shared counter
        // Mutex is automatically released when lock goes out of scope
    }
}

int main() {
    int numThreads = 5;
    int incrementsPerThread = 100;

    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    // Create and start threads
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        threads.push_back(std::thread(incrementCounter, incrementsPerThread));
    }

    // Join all threads with the main thread
    for (auto& th : threads) {
        th.join();
    }

    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << counter << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:


    Mutex (std::mutex mtx): This mutex is used to protect the shared resource, which in this case is the counter variable. We want to ensure that only one thread can modify the counter at a time to prevent data corruption.


    Thread Function (incrementCounter): This function is called by each thread and increments the shared counter variable. It uses std::lock_guard to lock the mutex. The mutex is automatically released when the lock_guard goes out of scope (i.e., when the loop iteration completes).

    Main Function:
        Thread Creation: We create several threads and each thread runs the incrementCounter function. The number of threads and the number of increments each thread should perform can be adjusted.
        Join Threads: After starting the threads, the main function waits for all threads to complete their execution using join() before it proceeds. This ensures that the main function only finishes after all threads are done.

This example safely handles concurrent modifications to a shared variable using mutexes. Let me know if you need further explanations or another example!
