| Filesystem |   | IP | https://github.com/camcarthur/os-camcarthur/tree/main/filesystems | The Dockerfile creates a container running ubuntu and then creates a filesystem with specific ACLs. In the image within the repo, you can see the Dockerfile get built and run, as well as the proper ownership for filesystem. The python file performs a recursive seach from an inputed directory to find all files with a specified suffix. It keeps track of visited directories and avoids symlinks to prevent cycles. |
